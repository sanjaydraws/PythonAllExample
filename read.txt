python  intro :
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.

It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.




variables : 
Variables are containers for storing data values.


Data Type:
Variables can store data of different types, 
and different types can do different things. 




------------------------------------
operator:
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Arithmetic Operators:
used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
+,-,*,/,%,**,//


Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=
//=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=

Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 

Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

and, or, not 


Identity Operators:
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, 
but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

is, isnot 



is vs == 

is -> object check 
== -> content check

Membership Operators:
 test if a sequence is presented in an object:

in , notin


Bitwise Operators:
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

&, |, ^, ~, <<, >> 

--------------------------------------------------------------
while Loop: while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

continue Statement:
continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:


for loop:
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works 
more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.


The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop
before it has looped through all the items:

----------------------------------------------
function :
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

Arguments
Information can be passed into functions as arguments.


A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
---------------------------------------------------




Recursion: 
which means a defined function can call itself.
This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.
-----------------------------------------------------


Arbitrary Arguments, *args:
 the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:

def my_function(*kids):
  print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])

my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")


----->
Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs
def my_function(**kid):
  print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])

my_function(fname = "Tobias", lname = "Refsnes")

Default Parameter Value:
def my_function(country = "Norway"):
  print("I am from " + country)

The pass Statement
function definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a function definition with no content,
put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
----------------------------------------------


User Input


casting: Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:


Strings: Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope -  variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.


Local Scope - variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function,
 and can only be used inside that function.



local variable can be accessed from a function within the function:
   x = 300
  def myinnerfunc():
    print(x)
  myinnerfunc()

myfunc()


Global Scope:- variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable 
and belongs to the global scope


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








Module :- A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.



Using the dir() Function
to list all the function names (or variable names) in a module.
The dir() function can be used on all modules, also the ones you create yourself.






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Arrays
used to store multiple values in one single variable:





lambda function 
can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.


x = lambda a, b : a * b
print(x(5, 6))
